It is just a concept of connecting different compoents through abstraction 
abstraction can be achieved by using either an interface or by using an abstract class
It prevents making cartesian product complexity explosion
(Like suppose I have two type of work and I have 3 system , So ultimately I need to create 2*3 class to implement the system in a way.This is known as cartesian product)



So bridge is a mechanism that decouples interface hierarchy from an implementations hierarchy
